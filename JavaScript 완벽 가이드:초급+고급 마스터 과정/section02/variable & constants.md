let userName='Max'; -> a "data container"/"data storage"

variable = a data container which holds some data and in Javascript, 
we create a variable by using the let keyword which you see here on the left, 
then a name of your choice with some naming rules then an equal sign and then 
the value you want to store in the variable.

if we assign a new value to it, we don't repeat that keyword, so we only nned the let keyword to let Javascript know that it is a brand new variable my program will need. -> if you then use that variable later
